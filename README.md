# Express Mongo Contact App

A contact app built with Express.js and MongoDB is a web application that allows users to manage their contacts. Users can add new contacts by filling out a form with information such as name, phone number, and email address. They can also search for existing contacts by name or other criteria, view detailed information about a specific contact, and delete contacts that are no longer needed. The Express.js framework is used to handle routing and server-side logic, while MongoDB is used to store and retrieve contact information.
